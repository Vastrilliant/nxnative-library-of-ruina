# Mods

Each folder is one mod. Every mod in this folder is built into every IPA, and each one is **off until the player turns it on**: the settings screen has a *Mods* section with one switch per mod (it sets the mod's env switch, e.g. `DM_MOD_SPEEDDICE=1`; `Documents/env.txt` wins over the screen). A change takes effect at the next start.

```
mods/<id>/
  mod.json   id, title, launcher (env, label, note of its switch), gates (names), obs (gate rows per build of main), host (C file), romfs (folder)
  host.c     callbacks for the gates (call dm_mod_gate_run from dm/host/hle_modcall.c to run on the guest stack); attaches them from a constructor with gate_obs_set(), and returns from each callback while its env switch is not 1 (read at the first gate hit: the launcher's choices are not in the environment yet when constructors run)
  romfs/     files for the RomFS overlay (Data/StreamingAssets/... as in the game's RomFS)
```

How it works: `scripts/apply_mods.py` numbers the gates (32-63), copies `host.c` into `dm/host/` (built by wildcard), writes `launcher_mods.json` (the Mods switches; `dm/games/settings.py` adds them to the app's `launcher.json` when `DM_MODS_SETTINGS` names the file, for the iOS and Mac builds alike), writes the gate rows the rewriter (`dm/tools/patch_nso.py`, `DM_MODS_PATCHES`) puts into the game's `main`, and merges the romfs folders into `romfs/` for `DM_ROMFS_OVERLAY`. A gate fires only in a build whose ID has rows in `mod.json`.

`dm/games/settings.py` is the one repo file this framework edits for the launcher (a `Mods` section and `mod_rows`).

Add a mod: copy `speed-dice/`, change the id, gates and `host.c`.

## Exefs patch mods

A mod with an `exefs` entry in its `mod.json` is made of Atmosphère exefs patches, the `.ips` / IPS32 and `.pchtxt` files as their author distributes them (Library-of-Ruina-NX-Mods), and needs no `host.c`:

```
mods/<id>/
  mod.json   id, title, launcher (env, label, note), exefs (the folder of the patch files)
  expect     optional: {build ID: {text offset: the game's original word}} for every patched word; apply_mods.py checks it covers the patches and the rewriter stops when the game's word differs (a wrong offset or build)
  exefs/     <NSO build ID>.ips (64 hex digits, the name Atmosphère uses) and / or *.pchtxt (@nsobid- line, hex patches, offset_shift as the file sets it)
```

Every word a patch changes becomes a switchable patch: `scripts/apply_mods.py` lists the words in `patches.json` (`SWITCH`, with the text offset, the mod's switch number and the patched word), and the rewriter (`dm/tools/patch_nso.py`, "Switchable patches"; stubs in `dm/tools/nso_switch.py`) replaces the instruction with a branch to a stub that runs the patched word when the mod's switch byte is 1 and the game's own word otherwise. `dm/host/hle_modsw.c` writes the bytes when the game starts from the mods' env switches (the Mods section of the launcher, `Documents/env.txt` wins), so with every switch off the game runs as it does without the mods. The choice is made at run time because the iPhone cannot write to code pages. A change takes effect at the next start, as for the other mods.

Offsets: an `.ips` file counts from the start of the NSO file (Atmosphère takes the 0x100-byte header off), a `.pchtxt` counts as `offset_shift` says; both give the text offset the rewriter uses (the same as the `obs` rows of the other mods). A patch must cover whole instructions at 4-byte aligned offsets, and only the build named in its file is patched (Library of Ruina 1.0.3, build ID `aeea627d...`). The rewrite log lists each site with the instruction it replaces (`switch N at ...`), and `main.switch.tsv` beside the rewritten modules has the same list: check a new patch's sites there. A site that is already a rewrite site (an x18, tpidr or svc instruction, a lock acquire) or an instruction the stub cannot move (`ldr` literal) stops the rewrite with a message.

On the device: the workflow uploads `mod-romfs`; copy its contents (the `Data/` folder) into the app's `Documents/` and add `DM_ROMFS_OVERLAY=<the folder that contains Data/>` to `env.txt` (the path of `Documents`, not of `Documents/Data`). Then switch the mod on under Mods.
