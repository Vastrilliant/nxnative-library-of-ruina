// Mods (shared by every mod; built always, by the host Makefile wildcard): run a gate callback on the guest's own stack, so that it can call the game's functions.
//
// An observation gate's callback runs on the thread's gate stack (entry.S dm_gate), and that stack was built for handlers that never run guest code:
//   - guest code issues SVCs and timer reads, which enter dm_gate again, take the same gate-stack top and overwrite the outer frame (dm_gate_nested stops it only when sp is in the window);
//   - Boehm's collector (IL2CPP) scans the thread from its sp up to its stack base, and an sp on the gate stack is outside that range;
//   - a managed pointer that only the host's frames hold would be on the gate stack, where nobody scans.
// dm_mod_gate_run fixes all three for the duration of one callback:
//   1. the thread's gate top (dm_gate_top[k]) is moved below the current host frame, so a nested gate builds its frame under the outer one and the outer frame survives;
//   2. fn runs on the guest stack, below the gate block's push and 512 bytes of margin for the guest's red zone, as if it were a guest function called from the gated instruction;
//      a pause request (on_pause_sig in hle_thread.c) then sees a pc in a module, an sp on the guest stack, and everything fn holds in frames the collector scans;
//   3. x0..x28 of the gate frame are copied into a frame on the guest stack and fn receives that copy, so the pointers the gated code held in registers are roots too.
// The copy is read-only: a callback that must change a register of the gated code cannot use this and runs on the gate stack as before.
// A callback that fires while another is running on the same thread (a game function the callback calls hits a gate of the same mod) returns at once.
