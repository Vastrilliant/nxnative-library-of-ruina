# Library of Ruina (`0100E7A019246000`)

Update 1.0.3 (v262144, display version 1.03) over the cartridge base, SDK 15.3.2, Unity 2021.3.19f1 IL2CPP with FMOD on NVN. Modules `main`, `subsdk0` (NintendoSDK_movie) and `sdk`, the `sdk` and `subsdk0` builds of Blasphemous 2.

Status: plays on the Mac at full speed, from a fresh save and from an existing one, through the title menu and into the game; on an earlier, slowed run, also the first Reception to its end and back to the library, with no `[RED]` line. On an iPhone, installed through Xcode, it was reported working with this profile; no log was read from that run. [GitHub issue #739](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/issues/739) reports the provisional profile on an iPhone 13 Pro Max.

## What it needs

| Setting | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `sys_resource 0x1000000` | [`game.tsv`](game.tsv) | The NPDM declares 16 MB of system resource, enabling virtual address memory |
| `mem_stack 0x28000000` (640 MB) | `game.tsv` | Unity's thread stacks are placed at random in the stack region; see [Memory](#memory) |
| 5 GB guest block, 4 GB alias region (`mem_alias 0x100000000`), `app_pool 0x40000000` | `game.tsv` | The larger stack region comes out of the alias region. The 1 GB pool keeps StandardAllocator's region at 0.94 GB and leaves the rest of the alias region to Unity's own regions, as in the other Unity profiles |
| `EntryScene` order cut (`main+0x21100e0`, `+0x210f5c0`, code over `LoadingManager.TestStart`) | [`patches.py`](patches.py), `main` build `aeea627d…` | The game's own race between its splash and its load; see [Boot](#boot) |
| `shader_groups /Data/=data` | `game.tsv` | The serialized files and Addressables bundles all live under `Data/` |

## Boot

- **Resolved: stuck on the opening movie's last frame; `Data/level1` never opens and a button does nothing** (issue #739's idle game, reproduced on the Mac). `EntryScene.Update` calls `OnPlayEnd` once `SplashScreen.isFinished`; `OnPlayEnd` makes `_option` (`+0x20`) and `_latestData`. A coroutine calls `GotoTitleOrSelectLanguge` when the Addressables load ends, and that hands `_option` to `SaveManager.LoadOptionData`. Nothing orders the two. Measured with `DM_PROBE`, method names from the metadata: stuck, the load ended at frame 496 and the splash at 526, and `StartMoveSceneCoroutine` was never called; working, the splash ended at 491 and the load at 507. The Switch's slower CPU and storage should always put the load last (a run slowed with `taskpolicy -b` and logging, the load at 44 s, works, and 5 of 5 unslowed boots stuck); a Mac finishes first. The race is in the game's code, so a cut changes it: `GotoTitleOrSelectLanguge` calls `OnPlayEnd` first when `_option` is null, and `OnPlayEnd` returns when `_option` exists, so `Update`'s later call does not replace what `LoadOptionData` read. Nothing is delayed. Checked at full speed, no throttling or extra logging: 5 of 5 boots open `level1`; a fresh save reaches the title menu; an existing save plays on.
- **Not** `OnCompleteInitializePlatform_xboxlive` for the cut's code: it has no direct caller but runs at startup on this platform too. A first cut over it started the scene at 3 s and gave the menu of placeholder outlines that the issue reports when a mod forces the movie past.

## Memory

- **Resolved: an `nn::diag` abort at `sdk+0x12ff04` (Result 0).** The backtrace is `nn::os::detail::ThreadManager::CreateThread` (`sdk+0x12a390`) → `ThreadManagerImplByHorizon::MapAliasStack`, under an IL2CPP thread pool worker (`main+0x303f78`): [Thread stacks placed at random in the stack region](../../../docs/reference/memory.md#thread-stacks-placed-at-random-in-the-stack-region). Issue #739's log ends in it at 32 s on an iPhone 13 Pro Max, with 12 `IL2CPP Threadpool worker` threads alive; the Mac at full speed has 2 at 65 s and 85 MB of stacks, so it never fails there. The pool grows when the machine is slow, and `taskpolicy -b` on the Mac gives the same result as the phone: with the provisional 256 MB stack region 3 of 4 boots abort at this address with 116–133 MB of stacks mapped; with 640 MB, 0 of 4, up to 157 MB of stacks mapped and 57 threads created.
- **Current:** through the first Reception on the Mac the alias region reached +3.01 GB of its 4 GB, with at most 1.52 GB mapped, about 2.5 GB resident and 1.1 GB of Metal allocations. With the hardware pool (3.21 GB) StandardAllocator's region alone ends at +3.21 GB and the opening story already reaches +4.00 GB.

## Files and shaders

- 760 UnityFS bundles (2.77 GB), most of them Addressables under `Data/StreamingAssets/aa/Switch`, in a 5.7 GB merged RomFS. The shader split finds 16,841 shaders and 8,373 pairs. The first boot prebuilds their pipelines, about 40 s on an M1.
- The game's opening movie plays on every start, about 2 minutes on the Mac, and takes a press only once the menu has loaded behind it.

## Mac routes

- A fresh save reaches the story's first scene with `DM_KEYS="142:A,150:A*40/4"`. `Plus` skips a story scene. In the first Invitation: `A` on the `?`, `A` on Canard's scene `I`, `R` to the book panel, `A` to take the Book of Something, `Plus` to send, `A` on the stamp; `Plus` on the stage screen begins the Reception.

## Found on this game

No host or tool change was needed. The boot race is the game's own ([Boot](#boot)). A second case of a general mechanism:

- **Thread stacks placed at random in the stack region:** [the reference entry](../../../docs/reference/memory.md#thread-stacks-placed-at-random-in-the-stack-region); its check as a reproduction on the Mac (`taskpolicy -b`).

## Open

- On an iPhone: a Reception and memory, on a 6 GB phone as in issue #739.
- The host's crash report can wedge: one aborted run with `DM_THR=1 DM_SVC=1` never exited, every thread, the aborting one included, blocked in `flockfile` on the log, and the `perl alarm` of `boot.sh` did not end it either (`CRASH sig=14` is reported through the same log). Who held the lock was not found.
- The first boot with `DM_WATCH_STALL=40`, which fired during the pipeline prebuild, printed nothing more for 190 s until its alarm; the next boot, without that stall time reached, ran normally. Not looked into.
- Later Receptions and floors: memory against the 4 GB alias region (`DM_REGIONS`, the `[mem]` lines).
